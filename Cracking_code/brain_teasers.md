## The Heavy Pill
Question: 20 bottles, 19 have pills of 1.0 grams one has pills of 1.1 grams. How do you find which bottle has 1.1 gram pills using a scale only once?

Answer: In order grab one pill from the first bottle, two pills from the second bottle, three from the third, etc. When you get the total weight, subtract 210 g from it. Multiply the result by 10, and that is the bottle with the extra weight. i.e. if the first bottle had 1.1 gram pills, the total weight would be 210.1, giving you a result of 0.1 x 10 => 1st bottle.

## Dominoes
Question: Two opposite corners are cut off of an 8x8 chessboard. Can 31 dominoes (taking two pieces each) be placed to cover the whole board?
Answer: No, it is impossible. An odd number line will always exist no matter how the dominoes are placed. Cleaner answer: Two same color corners are removed (say white), leaving 32 black and 30 white. Since a domino must cover one black and one white(none can be diagonally placed), it would be impossible.

## Ants on a Triangle
Question: Three ants are placed on three vertices of a triangle and start walking, choosing their direction at random. What are the odds of a collision.

Answer: This can be done by finding the odds of no collision, as the odds of a collision is equal to 100% - odds of no collision. Odds of no collision are each ant going the same direction as the first one, so (1/2)^(n-1). In this case, the odds of a collision are 1 - (1/2)^2, or 3/4.
